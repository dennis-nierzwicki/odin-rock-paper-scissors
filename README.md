# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is part of **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** curriculum.  
It’s my first **JavaScript** project involving **user input, randomness, validation, and game logic** — a browser-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game where you play against the computer.

Key features include:
- Asking the user how many rounds to play (minimum of 3).
- Validating user input for game setup and choices.
- Randomly generating the computer’s choice.
- Calculating scores for the user and the computer.
- Declaring the winner after all rounds.
- Offering to replay the game until the user quits.
